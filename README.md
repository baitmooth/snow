Snow is a simple monotone icon pack forked from [Frost](https://github.com/dkanada/frost). Snow is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is aiming to be simple with easy recognisable shapes.

Snow includes support for a lot of launchers like KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more. The installation depends on your launcher, it's probably somewhere in the settings.
Sadly actual LineageOS comes with an issue in Trebuchet which makes it incompatible with Snow.

Submitting icon requests helps a lot, but maintaining the project (as you may imagine) takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about adding new icons. Contributions for new icons are always welcome, and no experience with programming is necessary.

### Submitting icon requests

Historically [Turtl](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.xphnx.iconsubmit/) was used to collect the necessary information for adding missing icons. But now there is an awesome built-in feature to submit icon request right inside the app!  

A simple step-by-step guide:
1. Open Snow
2. Press the symbol on the upper-left corner and select `Icon Request`
3. Choose the missing apps you wish to submit, it's also possible to select/deselect all missing apps
4. Press the plane symbol and choose the app in the pop-up menu to send the icon request
5. Now you can check the information that will be sent via email, and if everything looks fine, simply send the email and it's done!

In case you accidentally close the app during the process, and want to clean the cache, there is an option named `Clear Icon Request Data` in `Settings` to do that.

### Making icons

Making icons is fun and **you don't even have to know how to code**. Just install a vector graphic program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), Illustrator, Affinity Designer, [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) or [Vector Asset Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inglesdivino.vectorassetcreator).
