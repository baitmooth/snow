Snow is a simple monotone icon pack forked from [Frost](https://github.com/dkanada/frost). Snow is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is aiming to be simple with easy recognisable shapes.

Snow includes support for a lot of launchers like KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more. The installation depends on your launcher, it's probably somewhere in the settings.
Sadly actual LineageOS comes with an issue in Trebuchet which makes it incompatible with Snow.

Submitting icon requests helps a lot, but maintaining the project (as you may imagine) takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about adding new icons. Contributions for new icons are always welcome, and no experience with programming is necessary.

### Submitting icon requests

#### Turtl

One way to request icons is to use [Turtl](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.xphnx.iconsubmit/).

1. Install Turtl

Needed to attach .zips:

     1. Open Your phones *settings*
     2. Type *turtl* into the search field
     3. Open the *app info* for Turtl
     4. Go to *permissions* and grant *Files and Media*
2. Open *Turtl*
3. If you have icons that broke after an update choose the first option
     1. Select the apps to report
     2. Tap the copy icon in the top right corner
     3. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/baitmooth/snow/issues/new?assignees=baitmooth&labels=activity+changed&template=broken-icons.md&title=Broken+Icons)
     4. Paste the content of the clipboard between the code tags
     5. Submit
4. If you have apps whose icons are not already part of Snow choose the second option
     1. Select the apps to request
     2. Tap the save icon in the top
     3. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/baitmooth/snow/issues/new?assignees=baitmooth&labels=new+icons%2C+small+request&template=requesting-new-icons.md&title=New+Icon+request)
     4. Fill the form
     5. Attach the .zip Turtl created ( will be in a directory *Turtl*)
     6. Submit

#### Snows built-in feature

This feature is not active at the moment, but will be very soon.
1. Open Snow
2. Press the symbol on the upper-left corner and select `Icon Request`
3. Choose the missing apps you wish to submit, it's also possible to select/deselect all missing apps
4. Press the plane symbol and choose the app in the pop-up menu to send the icon request
5. Now you can check the information that will be sent via email, and if everything looks fine, simply send the email and it's done!

In case you accidentally close the app during the process, and want to clean the cache, there is an option named `Clear Icon Request Data` in `Settings` to do that.

### Making icons

Making icons is fun and **you don't even have to know how to code**. Just install a vector graphic program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), Illustrator, Affinity Designer, [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) or [Vector Asset Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inglesdivino.vectorassetcreator).
